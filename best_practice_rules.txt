Best practices for team projects:

1) Define a research question that I aligned with all members' Interest. Should give some useful and novel insights. 
Should be achievable within time and other constrains. 


2) Discuss methodology to answer question. What data to obtain. What source to use. APIs or Wrappers to get data. 


3) Make schedule and divide the work. Have a plan B if things don't go as planned. 
Have a long discussion at the start to ensure a shared vision but limit meeting later for new issues and progress meetings. 


4) Define coding style and comply to it.
Make rules for variable and function naming. Such as camel, kebab or snake word connectors (One can be used for variables another for functions). 
Common names for each library import. 
Make rules on how to shorten words for efficiency while still understandable.
Mane logic names for functions, representing what they transform the input to. Also do this for the required inputs to the function and for the output being 'returned'
Rules should be made for making comments, indentations and line lengths. 
Also set rules for cleaning data such as what info to drop or change to get consistency as this can affect results significantly. 
Don't edit existing code without consulting team members. If you notice an issue, take it up with your team mates and find a solution. 
If they can not be reached, make a temporary code inlign with rules that can be changed at next meeting. 


5) Communicate through Slack for easy sharing.
Be constructive and keep a good mood to motivate all members.
Also, We're here to learn so don't necessarily assign tasks that you are best at. Do paired 'driver' and 'navigator' coding to learn from each other. 
Commit often!
